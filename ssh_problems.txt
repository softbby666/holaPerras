* user's configuration file ~/.ssh/config - This is the per-user configuration file. 
The format of this file is described above. This file is used by the SSH client. 
Because of the potential for abuse, this file must have strict permissions: read/write for the user, 
and not accessible by others.

This file provides defaults for those values that are not specified in the user's configuration file, 
and for those users who do not have a configuration file. This file must be world-readable.

SOLUCIONES POSIBLES:

ssh -F ~/.ssh/config your_user@your_host -  is taking the user configuration, 
                 : If you don't use -F, it also takes the global configuration, 
                  instead of ignoring it completely.
                 : The reason that this works is the -F option. It forces ssh 
                  to not use the system-wide config. This is most often the file 
                  that contains a setting like "Host *\n. SendEnv LANG LC_*"
                 : If a configuration file is given on the command line, 
                  the system-wide configuration file (/etc/ssh/ssh_config) will be ignore

ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa_fortrabbit {{app-name}}@deploy.{{region}}.frbit.com
-> To use a specific key run SSH and specify a different key than the default.
                 :If you use an unprotected key (no passphrase) and still get asked about a password, 
                 it may be the case that the key in the default location is not imported 
                 into fortrabbit.
                 :Adjust the path of the key (~/.ssh/id_rsa_fortrabbit). 
                 It needs to point to private key that you actually have on your machine.

ssh-keygen -A --> NO FUNCIONA
-A: For each of the key types (rsa1, rsa, dsa, ecdsa and ed25519) 
for which host keys do not exist, generate the host keys with the default key 
file path, an empty passphrase, default bits for the key type, and default comment. 
This is used by /etc/rc to generate new host keys.

Follow these steps to regenerate OpenSSH Host Keys:
                 Delete old ssh host keys: rm /etc/ssh/ssh_host_*
                 Reconfigure OpenSSH Server: dpkg-reconfigure openssh-server
                 Update all ssh client(s) ~/.ssh/known_hosts files

Set the remote url on my local machine by copying the ssh url type of my repository:  
        git remote set-url origin git@github.com:username/your-repository.git
        replace git@github.com:username/your-repository.git with your ssh url from git hub.
