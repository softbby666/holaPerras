A host key is the server's public key. The host key is used by the client 
to decrypt an authentication message sent from the server when connecting. 
The basic purpose of the host key is to ensure that when you connect 
to a remote host, it is actually the host that you intended to connect to.
debug: Host 'github.com' is known and matches the ED25519 host key.

When you use an SSH key, that comes from your user's home directory, 
and when you use an SSH agent, that comes from the environment.


ssh-copy-id username@hostname -> copy the public key to the remote server
Enter the remote user password, and the public key will be appended to 
the remote user authorized_keys file.
Once the key is uploaded, you can log in to the remote server 
without being prompted for a password.

# This is the ssh client system-wide configuration file.  See
# ssh_config(5) for more information.  This file provides defaults for
# users, and the values can be changed in per-user configuration files
# or on the command line.
# Configuration data is parsed as follows:
#  1. command line options
#  2. user-specific file
#  3. system-wide file
# Any configuration value is only changed the first time it is set.
# Thus, host-specific definitions should be at the beginning of the
# configuration file, and defaults at the end.

# This Include directive is not part of the default ssh_config shipped with
# OpenSSH. Options set in the included configuration files generally override
# those that follow.  The defaults only apply to options that have not been
# explicitly set.  Options that appear multiple times keep the first value set,
# unless they are a multivalue option such as IdentityFile.
Include /etc/ssh/ssh_config.d/*

# Site-wide defaults for some commonly used options.  For a comprehensive
# list of available options, their meanings and defaults, please see the
# ssh_config(5) man page.

# Host * - Restricts the following declarations (up to the next Host keyword) 
  to be only for those hosts that match one of the patterns given after the keyword. 
  If more than one pattern is provided, they should be separated by whitespace. 
  A single '*' as a pattern can be used to provide global defaults for all hosts. 
  The host is the hostname argument given on the command line 
  (i.e. the name is not converted to a canonicalized host name before matching).

#   ForwardAgent no
#   ForwardX11 no
#   PasswordAuthentication yes
#   HostbasedAuthentication no
#   GSSAPIAuthentication no
#   GSSAPIDelegateCredentials no
#   BatchMode no - If set to ''yes'', passphrase/password querying will be disabled. 
    This option is useful in scripts and other batch jobs where no user is present 
    to supply the password. The argument must be ''yes'' or ''no''. The default is ''no''.
#   CheckHostIP yes - If this flag is set to ''yes'', ssh(1) will additionally check the 
    host IP address in the known_hosts file. This allows ssh to detect if a host key 
    changed due to DNS spoofing. If the option is set to ''no'', the check will not be executed. 
    The default is ''yes''.
